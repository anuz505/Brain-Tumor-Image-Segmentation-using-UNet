# Brain Tumor Segmentation with UNet

This project focuses on segmenting brain tumors using the UNet architecture. It involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, visualization, dataset splitting, and model training.

## Setup

1. **Change Runtime to GPU**
   - Navigate to `Runtime` -> `Change runtime type` -> Select `T4 GPU` -> Click `Save`

2. **Importing the Segmentation Dataset**
   - Mount Google Drive to access the dataset.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Visualize MRI scans, masks, and overlay images to understand the dataset better.

4. **Dataset Split and DataLoaders**
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
   - Create custom DataLoader objects for each dataset split.

5. **UNet Model**
   - Define the UNet model architecture for segmentation tasks.

## Training and Evaluation

Once the model is defined, proceed with training and evaluating the model using the provided DataLoaders and UNet architecture.
